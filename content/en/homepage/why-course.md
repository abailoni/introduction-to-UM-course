**Maybe you're brand new to meditation** and you're not sure how to start or what to do, so  you'd like clear, "how to" instructions on how to practice.

**Or maybe you've tried to start, but you're having trouble getting yourself to practice** regularly because you feel like you're spinning your wheels, going nowhere, so you'd like support and accountability to keep you on track and inspired to practice.

Maybe you have an established practice, but **you feel like you've plateaued** or hit a dead end. And you're not sure how to break through to the next level, so you'd like new techniques that help you to bring your practice into your daily activities.

**Maybe you're highly experienced in other contemplative practices** and you'd like to know how the UniÔ¨Åed Mindfulness framework can enhance your existing practice with an interactive, algorithmic system that gives you a broad range of new options to explore.

In any case, the Introduction to Unified Mindfulness 8-week training is designed to meet you where you are, **whether you're brand new to meditation or you have years of experience** in other contemplative practices.

##### In the course you'll learn techniques to systematically optimize your existing contemplative practices (if you have any) and strengthen your focus so you can be more present in your life, your work, and with the people close to you.
