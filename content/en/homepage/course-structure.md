1. Through a guided tour, you'll explore some Unified Mindfulness techniques to discover the ones that are **most meaningful to you**, so you can apply them whenever you want. 

2. Each technique you learn may **help you deepen positive states**, such as joy, or it may help you **better address challenging states**, such as chatter in the mind.

3. And you'll learn techniques that can be **applied in any situation you can possibly think of.**

4. They could help you **make the most of a pleasant situation**, like enjoying a hike through the woods.

5. Or they could help you manage a diï¬ƒcult one, like **dealing with stress, burnout or difficult relationships** with people in your life (including the relationship you have with yourself).

6. **[UM's comprehensive system](https://www.shinzen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IntroToUltra_ver4.8.pdf) covers all contemplatives approaches and "unifies" :-) them in a [clear framework](https://wiki.unifiedmindfulness.com/index.php/Universal_Library_for_Training_Attention)** that's so rigorously precise, institutions like Harvard Medical School, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Vermont use it as the basis for their research on meditation and its application in the neurosciences, psychology, clinical sciences.
