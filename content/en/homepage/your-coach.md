Hi, I'm Alberto and will be the instructor for this course. **I began practicing mindfulness and meditation in 2019 primarily to manage chronic stress and anxiety.** 

After one to two years of inconsistent practice, I delved deeper into Shamatha concentration practices (focusing mainly on the breath), and **explored Hindu and Tibetan traditions that combined meditation with intense pranayamas**. These practices gradually helped me better handle daily stress.

However, **it wasn't until I discovered the Unified Mindfulness System at the end of 2022 that my meditation practice became much more consistent and enjoyable**. I quickly began seeing real benefits and more profound changes in my life.

With a background in theoretical physics and computer science, **I was immediately drawn to the unusually rigorous and algorithmic approach of the Unified Mindfulness System**, initially ideated by Shinzen Young. What I particularly liked was that this system didn't promote a specific meditation practice or belief, but offered instead a comprehensive set of tools unifying and clarifying most main contemplative practices, allowing you to explore a wide range of techniques/traditions and apply the most meaningful ones for you at any given moment, whenever needed.

**Mindfulness and meditation have helped me overcome chronic stress and various health challenges**, deepening my self-understanding. After years of exploring common self-help and personal development techniques, I now see mindfulness as the most powerful catalyst for inner growth I have ever encountered. It **has significantly increased my resilience to life's challenges, and is currently helping me manage anxiety, mild depression and bipolar mood swings, and improving my moment-by-moment awareness, positivity, and overall well-being**.

Because of this journey, I felt more and more inspired to share this knowledge with others, so I recently decided to **become a Certified Unified Mindfulness Coach** and start to learn how to more skillfully guide others in their mindfulness journey.
