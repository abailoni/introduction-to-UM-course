Hi, I'm Alberto, your guide for this meditation course. I started practicing mindfulness and meditation in 2019 to manage stress and anxiety. After exploring various traditions, I found the Unified Mindfulness System in 2022, which revolutionized my practice.

With a background in theoretical physics and computer science, I was drawn to the systematic approach of Unified Mindfulness. It doesn't push any specific practice or belief, but offers a comprehensive toolkit to explore different techniques.

Meditation has helped me navigate stress, health challenges, and mood swings. This got me convinced to train as a Certified Unified Mindfulness Coach, and I'm excited to share these practices with you!

[//]: # (After one to two years of inconsistent practice, I delved deeper into Shamatha concentration practices and **explored Hindu and Tibetan traditions that combined meditation with intense pranayamas**. These practices gradually helped me better handle daily stress.)

[//]: # (However, **it wasn't until I discovered the Unified Mindfulness System at the end of 2022 that my meditation practice became much more consistent and enjoyable**. I quickly began seeing real benefits and more profound changes in my life.)

[//]: # (With a background in theoretical physics and computer science, **I was immediately drawn to the unusually rigorous and algorithmic approach of the Unified Mindfulness System**, initially ideated by Shinzen Young. What I particularly liked was that this system didn't promote a specific meditation practice or belief, but offered instead a comprehensive set of tools unifying and clarifying most main contemplative practices, allowing you to explore a wide range of techniques/traditions and apply the most meaningful ones for you at any given moment, whenever needed.)

They have significantly **boosted my resilience to life's challenges** and are currently aiding me in managing anxiety and mild bipolar mood swings, while enhancing my moment-to-moment awareness, positivity, and overall well-being.)

[//]: # (Inspired by this journey, I felt motivated to **train as a Certified Unified Mindfulness Coach** to learn how to more skillfully guide others in their mindfulness practices.)
